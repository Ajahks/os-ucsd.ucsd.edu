How to Contribute to the OS Website 🚀

Setup 💻 :
Step 1: 
  Make sure you have node and npm on your local machine
  Do npm -v and node -v to see your current version (means that you have it installed)
  If you don’t have it installed, follow here: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/
Step 2:
  Fork https://github.com/os-ucsd/os-ucsd.ucsd.edu
Step 3: 
  Clone the forked repo to local machine git clone [forked-repo-url] 
Step 4: 
  cd into the cloned repo cd os-ucsd.ucsd.edu
Step 5: 
  Set up origin as your forked repo and upstream as original repo
  git remote add origin [forked-repo-url] (same as clone url; if it says origin is already added then you’re all set for this step) 
  git remote add upstream [original-repo-url] 
  You’ll be doing git pull upstream to get updates from the original repo and git push origin master to push your changes to your forked repo
  git push origin master (push your changes to your forked repo)
  *this is for after you have made edits*
  git pull upstream master (get updates from original repo)
Step 6: 
  Setting up react: npm install
Step 7: 
  To see the current site: npm start
Step 8: 
  you can start editing code now :)
  
  
How to push your edited code and merge with original repository 👩‍💻:
Step 1: 
  git add . 
Step 2: 
  git commit -m”some message”
Step 3: 
  git pull upstream master 
  *important: make sure you have set the upstream in setup^*
Step 4: 
  Fix merge conflicts (if there is)
Step 5: 
  git add . (yep, again)
Step 6:  
  git commit -m”another message”
Step 7: 
  git push origin master (this should update the code in your forked repository; the original repo has not been changed yet)
Step 8: 
  go to your forked repository on Github 
  *not the original one*
Step 9: 
  Click where it says Pull requests (next to Code)
Step 10: 
  Click New Pull Request
Step 11: 
  Make sure it looks like this
Step 12: 
  Complete the pull request - A collaborator will review/accept your pull request
Step 13: 
  The original repository now has your code
Step 13: 
  EYYY you have successfully contributed to our website☺️
